# Scene Director - Animation-Hybrid Pipeline

## When To Use

You are the Scene Planner for a generated explainer video. You have a `script` artifact with timestamped sections and enhancement cues. Your job is to transform the script into a visual plan: what the viewer sees at every moment, what assets need to be created, and how scenes transition.

This is where words become visuals. A great script with a bad scene plan produces a confusing video.

## Prerequisites

| Layer | Resource | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Schema | `schemas/artifacts/scene_plan.schema.json` | Artifact validation |
| Prior artifacts | `state.artifacts["script"]["script"]`, `state.artifacts["proposal"]["proposal_packet"]` | Script sections and proposal packet |
| Playbook | Active style playbook | Palette, typography, motion consistency |
| Layer 3 Skills | `.agents/skills/` for planned scene types (`whiteboard-animate`, `remotion-best-practices`, `hyperframes`, `manim`, etc.) | Physics, layout constraints, and mechanics of chosen scene types |

## Process

### Step 1: Analyze the Script

Read every section. For each, note:
- What concept is being explained?
- What enhancement cues did the script writer embed?
- What's the emotional beat? (curiosity, revelation, emphasis, humor, conclusion)
- How much time is available? (end_seconds - start_seconds)

### Step 2: Research Visual Approaches

**Use web search** to find visual techniques for this topic:

1. **How do top creators visualize this?** Search YouTube thumbnails, blog diagrams, conference slides for the topic.
2. **What visual metaphors work?** Some concepts have well-known visual representations (e.g., neural networks as node graphs, encryption as locks/keys). Use these — viewers recognize them instantly.
3. **What's novel?** Is there a visual approach nobody has tried? A fresh visualization can make an explainer memorable.
4. **What's feasible?** Match your ambitions to available tools: `image_selector` (static images), `diagram_gen` (Mermaid flowcharts/sequences), `code_snippet` (syntax-highlighted code), Remotion (motion graphics, text animations), Manim (mathematical animations).

If you encounter a visualization need that no existing skill covers, use the **Skill Creator** (`skills/meta/skill-creator.md`) to create a new skill. 
Also, if a specific scene can’t be realized by the current OpenMontage technical opportunities or agent AI capabilities (for example, you want a visualization from a private source where authorization is required or you need a screenshot of a critical special document that the AI agent cannot find accurately through regular search) use `user_scene` type which triggers User to manually provide needed visuals.

### Step 3: Decompose into Scenes

Transform each script section into 1-3 visual scenes. Each scene is a distinct visual moment.

```json
{
  "id": "scene-3",
  "type": "diagram",
  "description": "Mermaid flowchart showing query → encode → vector search → rank → return results. Nodes appear one by one as narrator describes each step.",
  "start_seconds": 15,
  "end_seconds": 22,
  "script_section_id": "s3",
  "framing": "full-screen diagram, centered",
  "movement": "progressive reveal left-to-right",
  "transition_in": "fade",
  "transition_out": "dissolve",
  "overlay_notes": "Label each node as it appears",
  "required_assets": [
    {
      "type": "diagram",
      "description": "Mermaid flowchart: query → encode embedding → vector search (ANN) → rank by cosine similarity → return top-k results",
      "source": "generate"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Mandatory Disclaimer Scene Configuration:**
If the active playbook declares a `disclaimer` object with `position != "none"`:
- `placement`: Insert at the position specified by `playbook.disclaimer.position` (`"end"` or `"start"`).
- `type`: `"text_card"` (or static pre-rendered image asset from `playbook.disclaimer.asset_path`).
- `duration`: Hold duration specified by `playbook.disclaimer.duration_seconds` (default: 3.5s).
- `content`: Displays the disclaimer text or card clearly formatted for complete legibility.

**Zero-key scene warning:** This pipeline requires an active image generation API key for the `whiteboard_animate` tool. Do NOT attempt to build a "zero-key" scene plan consisting only of Remotion components. If no image generation is available, you must warn the user.

### Step 4: Apply the Visual Technique Library

These are proven patterns for explainer visuals. Reference them by name in scene descriptions:

**Whiteboard Narrative Anchor**
Use for storytelling, analogies, and breaking down complex ideas into visual metaphors. 
- Tools: `whiteboard_animate`
- Example: "Whiteboard sketch of the nervous system. direction: top-to-bottom. The brain is drawn first, then the spinal cord as the narrator mentions signals."

**Diagram Reveal**
Build a diagram progressively — start empty, add components with labels as the narrator describes each part. Perfect for architecture, processes, and systems.
- Tools: Mermaid + Remotion animation or FLUX-generated diagram
- Example: "Show the vector database architecture. Add the encoder node when narrator says 'embeddings'. Add the index when narrator says 'search'."

**Analogy Visualization**
Show the abstract concept alongside its real-world analogy. Split screen or side-by-side.
- Tools: `image_selector` for both sides
- Example: "Left: actual vector space with dots. Right: a library with books sorted by topic."

**Stat Card Punch**
Full-screen number with impact animation (scale up, slight bounce). Use `stat_card` type with a background and accent treatment chosen for the video's identity. Hold for 4-5 seconds.
- Tools: Remotion StatCard component
- Example: stat="1ms", subtitle="vs 500ms with traditional search", accentColor="<theme_accent>"

**Data Dashboard Sequence**
A series of data visualization scenes that tell a story through numbers. Start with a KPI overview, then drill into specific charts. Use section_title overlays to group related data. This pattern works with zero external tools.
- Tools: Remotion chart components (bar_chart, line_chart, pie_chart, kpi_grid)
- Example: kpi_grid (4 key stats) → bar_chart (breakdown) → line_chart (trend) → pie_chart (distribution)
- Choose the background treatment from the visual identity: dark for dramatic/technical subjects, light for approachable/educational, textured or warm when the topic calls for it.

**Before/After Split**
Show the problem, then the solution using `comparison` type. The comparison card shows dual values side-by-side with animated entrance.
- Tools: Remotion ComparisonCard component
- Example: leftLabel="Before", leftValue="500ms", rightLabel="After", rightValue="1ms"

**Timeline Progression**
Left-to-right or top-to-bottom sequence showing evolution or process steps. Each step appears as narrator describes it.
- Tools: Remotion with animated elements or Mermaid timeline
- Example: "1990: keyword search → 2010: semantic search → 2020: vector databases → 2024: multimodal search"

**Zoom and Focus**
Start with a wide view of a system, then zoom into a specific component to explain it in detail. Creates spatial context.
- Tools: Remotion with scale animation on a generated image
- Example: "Show full system architecture. Zoom into the 'embedding model' component."

**Code Walkthrough**
Show code with syntax highlighting. Highlight specific lines as the narrator explains them. Can animate typing or progressive reveal.
- Tools: `code_snippet` tool + Remotion
- Example: "Python code: `results = collection.query(embedding, n_results=5)`. Highlight `embedding` parameter when narrator says 'vector'."

### Step 4b: Visual Pacing & Duration Alignment with Script

Verify that the visuals and holds for each scene cleanly fit the duration of the approved script sections (`script.sections`).

1. The total duration of all visual scenes assigned to section `sX` must match `sX.end_seconds - sX.start_seconds`.
2. Allocate time for scene transitions and holds for Breathing Room.
3. For complex visuals, ensure the visual duration provides enough time for elements to fully render and hold and viewers can fully absorb the visual information before the next beat begins.

### Step 4c: 5-Aspect Scene-Plan Checklist

> Every scene must specify all five aspects. For diagram, chart, and Remotion-native scenes, "Subject" can map to a foregrounded data element and "Camera" can be marked N/A — but only EXPLICITLY (e.g., `"camera": "N/A — Remotion native scene, no virtual camera"`). Silent omission is the most common failure mode and produces unpredictable model output, brittle prompts, and reviewer churn.
>
> 1. **Subject** — type + key visual attributes; if multiple, how to disambiguate. For diagram/chart scenes, this is the foregrounded data element (the node, the bar, the KPI being highlighted). For generated images, it's the person/object/concept being illustrated.
> 2. **Subject Motion** — actions in temporal order; for animated diagrams, the order in which nodes/edges/values appear or change.
> 3. **Scene** — overlays (separately!) + POV + setting + time of day + scene dynamics. For Remotion scenes, "setting" maps to background treatment + theme.
> 4. **Spatial Framing** — shot size + position-in-frame + depth (FG/MG/BG) + camera-height-relative; and how those CHANGE. For static Remotion scenes, document the layout grid + which element occupies the visual center.
> 5. **Camera** — playback speed → lens distortion → height → angle → focus/DoF → steadiness → movement. Mark N/A for native-Remotion scenes; specify fully for `generated`/`broll`/`image_animation` scenes.
>
> See `skills/creative/video-gen-prompting.md` for the primitive vocabulary.

> **Overlays callout.** Overlays (titles, subtitles, HUD, watermarks, framing graphics, lower-thirds, section_title bars, stat_reveal chips, hero_title overlays, provider chips) are NOT part of the scene's foreground/midground/background depth axis. List them separately in scene metadata (`overlays: [...]`) with content and placement. Never describe an overlay as "in the foreground" — that confuses both downstream tools and any video-understanding model that re-analyzes the output.

### Step 5: Use Metadata For Timing Rules

Recommended metadata keys:

- `animatic_rules`
- `transition_rules`
- `hold_rules`
- `tool_path_map`
- `reusable_motifs`

### Step 6: Validate Against Playbook

The style playbook constrains your visual choices:

| Playbook Field | Scene Impact |
|----------------|-------------|
| `visual_language.color_palette` | All generated images and diagrams must use these colors |
| `visual_language.composition` | Framing rules (rule-of-thirds, centered, etc.) |
| `motion.transitions` | Allowed transition types (e.g., `gentle-fade`, `soft-dissolve`) |
| `motion.animation_style` | Animation feel (e.g., `ease-in-out, organic curves`) |
| `motion.pacing_rules` | Minimum hold times (e.g., "hold establishing shots for 2s minimum") |
| `asset_generation.image_prompt_prefix` | Distill into a short visual anchor; do not paste verbatim into all prompts |
| `asset_generation.consistency_anchors` | What must stay consistent across all images (color palette, lighting, style) |

**Checklist before submitting:**
- [ ] Every scene uses playbook-compatible transitions
- [ ] All required_asset descriptions include style cues from the playbook
- [ ] No scene violates pacing rules (min/max duration)
- [ ] Image descriptions reference the video's actual visual identity, not just a preset name

### Step 7: Verify Coverage and Variety

**Coverage check:**
- [ ] Scenes span the full script duration (first scene starts at 0s, last scene ends at total_duration)
- [ ] Every script section has at least one corresponding scene
- [ ] No gaps > 1s between scenes (unless intentional beat)
- [ ] All enhancement cues from the script are addressed by a scene or required_asset

**Variety check:**
- [ ] 100% single-type videos are forbidden
- [ ] No more than 4 consecutive scenes of the same type
- [ ] At least 3 different scene types used if the video is longer than 60s
- [ ] Visual pacing alternates between high-information scenes (diagrams, whiteboard, animations) and breathing room (text cards, generated images)

### Step 8: Self-Evaluate

Score (1-5):

| Criterion | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **Visual storytelling** | Does each scene advance understanding, not just decorate? |
| **Script alignment** | Does every scene match what the narrator is saying at that moment? |
| **Technique variety** | Did you use multiple visual techniques, not just one? |
| **Playbook fidelity** | Would every scene look like it belongs to the same video? |
| **Asset feasibility** | Can every required_asset actually be generated with available tools? |
| **Pacing** | Does the visual rhythm feel natural? High-info scenes balanced with breathing room? |

If any dimension scores below 3, revise.

### Step 9: Submit

Call `handle_explainer_scene_plan(state, {"scene_plan": scene_plan_json})` to validate and persist.

## Common Pitfalls

- **One scene per section**: Script sections often cover multiple concepts. A 10-second section might need 2-3 visual scenes to avoid boring stasis, except `whiteboard_animate` scene type which has it's own timing requirements.
- **Ignoring enhancement cues**: The script writer embedded visual hints in `enhancement_cues`. Don't ignore them — they represent the writer's visual intent.
- **Overly ambitious animations**: "Photorealistic 3D fly-through of a data center" can't be generated with current tools. Keep it achievable. Overanimating text-heavy scenes.
- **No transition strategy**: Random transitions feel chaotic. Use the playbook's transition rules consistently. Reserve special transitions for topic shifts.
- **Vague required_assets**: "An image about databases" is useless for prompt engineering. "Isometric illustration of a vector database with embedding vectors floating in 3D space, using the playbook's blue-green palette" is actionable.
- **Preset thinking**: A scene plan that says "make it flat-motion-graphics" is not enough. The planner must specify what makes THIS video's motion graphics feel distinct.
- **Static scenes for dynamic concepts**: If the narrator describes a process or transformation, the visual should move. Use animation or progressive reveal, not a static image.
- **Using `generated` type for CTA/closing screens with exact text**: AI image models hallucinate text — wrong business names, misspelled words, wrong phone numbers. Any scene with verbatim text (CTA, business info, contact details, legal) MUST be `type: "text_card"` so Remotion renders the text exactly. Never plan a `generated` image for a scene where text accuracy matters.

## Gate Reminder (Binding)

This stage gates on human approval (`human_approval_default: true`). After review passes:
checkpoint with `status="awaiting_human"`, present the summary (the Backlot board renders
the artifact), and **END YOUR TURN**. Do not start the next stage in the same response.
Approval is per-gate — an earlier "go ahead" does not cover this gate.
